### **Covariance Switch-Based Invariant Extended Kalman Filter**  
**2023.10 – Present**  

- The ineffectiveness and effectiveness of introducing covariance switch on the original InEKF are theoretically demonstrated for the first time.
- Theoretical analyses and experimental verifications for the first time prove that, under the framework of covariance switch, the state correction steps based on the target error definition and the original error definition are equivalent.
- Numerical simulations and field tests demonstrate that introducing covariance switch can significantly improve the convergence speed and consistency compared with the original L-InEKF and R-InEKF when the observation model does not match that of the process model.

### **Pose-Only Representation-Based MSC-InEKF for Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)**  
**2024.6 – Present**  

- Pose-Only Representation-Based Observation Model: utilizing camera poses and visual observations to analytically represent depth, eliminating the process for triangulation to reconstruct 3D feature points.
- MSC-InEKF: multi-state constraint invariant extended Kalman filter, addressing the inconsistency caused by model linearization error.
- Contributions: explicitly eliminating 3D feature points from the measurement equations and solving the consistency issues in VIO.

### **Pedestrian Navigation System**  
**2023.5 – 2023.10**  

- Indoor Pedestrian Positioning System: dual foot-mounted IMUs and ultrasonic distance sensors, combined with human motion constraints, for positioning in GNSS-denied environments.

### **An Multi-sensor Information Fusion and Validation Platform**  
**2024.4 – 2024.6**  

- Platform Details: complete hardware platform construction concluding sensors such as IMU (Xsens MTi-670, Adis 16505-2, 16495-1,), wheel encoder, and stereo camera (Realsense D435i), providing a foundational algorithm validation platform for the evaluation of multi-sensor fusion algorithms.
